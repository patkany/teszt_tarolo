Introduction to Pages
=====================

The GitHub Pages feature allows you to publish content to the web by simply pushing content to one of your GitHub hosted repositories. There are two different kinds of Pages that you can create: User Pages and Project Pages.

User & Organization Pages
-------------------------

Let's say your GitHub username is "alice". If you create a GitHub repository named `alice.github.com`, commit a file named `index.html` into the `master` branch, and push it to GitHub, then this file will be automatically published to [http://alice.github.com/](http://alice.github.com/).

On the first push, it can take up to ten minutes before the content is available.

The same works for organizations.  If your org account is named "PlanEx", creating the repo `planex.github.com` under the org will publish pages to <http://planex.github.com/>.

Real World Example: [github.com/defunkt/defunkt.github.com](http://github.com/defunkt/defunkt.github.com/) &rarr; [http://defunkt.github.com/](http://defunkt.github.com/).
